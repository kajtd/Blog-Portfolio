      Hi I'm Kajetan, web developer based in Poland. I like building apps and
      documenting my journey through written content :))
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm md:text-base">
      Over the course of last two years, I've worked on many different projects
      and applications, using different technologies, from JavaScript
      frameworks, like <span class="text-green-500/90 font-semibold">Vue</span>,
      to No-Code tools, like
      <span class="text-blue-500/80 font-semibold">Bubble</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm md:text-base">
      I like to think that developing websites or applications can be achieved
      in multiple different ways. Also, that it is important to step out of your
      comfort zone, try different things, and use tools that fit you, not
      others.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm md:text-base">
      What I like the most is a mix of both code and no-code solutions. That
      way, Iâ€™m able to ship apps faster, but also have the flexibility to make
      them personal.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm md:text-base">
      Besides developing, I enjoy topics like productivity, SEO, and wellness.
      Youâ€™ll also often find me going for a calming walk in the forest ðŸŒ³
    </p>
